# Introduction to custom types

You can plot anything in a chart as soon as you let the library how to handle that object, LiveCharts already supports 
the types `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `decimal`, their nullable versions `short?`, `int?`, `long?`, `float?`, 
`double?`, `decimal?`, and also some objects that are able to update automatically the changes to the UI like the 
[ObservableValue](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.ObservableValue), 
[ObservablePoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.ObservablePoint) (useful to specify both, X and Y), 
[WeightedPoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.WeightedPoint) (used in bubble charts), 
[DateTimePoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.DateTimePoint) (the X coordinate is of type `DateTime`),
[TimeSpanPoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.TimeSpanPoint) (the X coordinate is of type `TimeSpan`),
[ObservablePoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.ObservablePolarPoint) (used in polar charts)
[FinancialPoint](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.FinancialPoint) and
[FinancialPointI](https://lvcharts.com/api/{{ version }}/LiveChartsCore.Defaults.FinancialPointI) (to create candlestick charts).

Imagine the case that we have a json file that contains the temperature of a CPU at a given time, we want to build a chart with that data.

```json
[
  {
    "Time": 1,
    "Temperature": 65.65,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  },
  {
    "Time": 5,
    "Temperature": 62.23,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  },
  {
    "Time": 8,
    "Temperature": 85.12,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  }
]
```

We can read that file, and deserialize it to an array of `TempSample` class.

```c#
using var streamReader = new StreamReader("data.json");
var samples = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TempSample[]>(streamReader.ReadToEnd());

// now we just build the chart 
var chart = new SKCartesianChart
{
    Width = 900,
    Height = 600,
    Series = new[]
    {
        new LineSeries<TempSample>
        {
            Values = samples
        }
    },
    XAxes = new[] { new Axis { Labeler = value => $"{value} seconds" } },
    YAxes = new[] { new Axis { Labeler = value => $"{value} °C" } }
};

chart.SaveImage("chart.png");
```

The code above will throw because LiveCharts need to know how to plot the `TempSample` class; we can teach LiveCharts how to handle 
the `TempSample` class by setting a Mapper or implementing `IChartEntity` in our `City` class. 

## Mappers

Mappers is the easiest way but has a performance cost, a mapper is a method that takes both the `instance` (that we are drawing) 
and the `point` (that LiveCharts assigned) as parameters, inside this function we must specify the X and Y coordinates of the city class.

```c#
using var streamReader = new StreamReader("data.json");
var samples = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TempSample[]>(streamReader.ReadToEnd());

// now we just build the chart 
var chart = new SKCartesianChart
{
    Width = 900,
    Height = 600,
    Series = new[]
    {
        new LineSeries<TempSample>
        {
            Values = samples,
            Mapping = (sample, chartPoint) => // mark
            { // mark
                // use temperature as primary value (normally Y) // mark
                chartPoint.PrimaryValue = sample.Temperature; // mark
                // use time as secondary value (normally X) // mark
                chartPoint.SecondaryValue = sample.Time; // mark
                
                // sometimes it is useful to use the index of the instance in the array as the X coordinate: // mark
                // chartPoint.SecondaryValue = chartPoint.Index; // mark
            } // mark
        }
    },
    XAxes = new[] { new Axis { Labeler = value => $"{value} seconds" } },
    YAxes = new[] { new Axis { Labeler = value => $"{value} °C" } }
};

chart.SaveImage("chart.png");
```

Now it works! You can also register the mapper globally, this means that every time the `TempSample` class is used in a 
chart all over our application, the library will use the mapper we indicated.

``` c#
// ideally this code must be placed where your application or view starts
LiveCharts.Configure(config =>
    config
        .HasMap<TempSample>(
            (sample, chartPoint) =>
            {
                chartPoint.PrimaryValue = sample.Temperature;
                chartPoint.SecondaryValue = sample.Time;
            }));
```

Global mappers are unique for a type, this means that every time a `TempSample` instance is in a chart, LiveCharts will use this mapper,
if You register again a global mapper for the `TempSample` class, then the previous will be replaced by the new one.
If the series specifies the `Mapping` property, then the global mapper will be ignored and instead it will use the series instance mapper.

## IChartEntity

The `IChartEntity` interface force our points to have a [Coordinate](https://lvcharts.com/api/2.0.0-beta.710/LiveChartsCore.Kernel.Coordinate),  LiveCharts will use this property to build the plot, when the interface is implemented correctly, you will notice a considerable 
performance improvement, specially in large data sets.

Imagine the same case we used in the previous sample where we have a json file that contains the temperature of a CPU at a given time, 
we want to build a chart with that data.

```json
[
  {
    "Time": 1,
    "Temperature": 65.65,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  },
  {
    "Time": 5,
    "Temperature": 62.23,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  },
  {
    "Time": 8,
    "Temperature": 85.12,
    "Unit": "Celcius"
  }
]
```

We need a class to deserialize the json file, we can try this:

```c#
public class TempSample
{
    public int Time { get; set; }
    public double Temperature { get; set; }
}
```

That is enough to read the data from the json file, but there are 2 things missing in that class, 1. It does not notifies
the UI to update when a property changes, 2. LiveChars doesn't know how to draw this class. We need to implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`
and `IChartEntity` to fix both issues.

To reduce the amount of boilerplate we will use the CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, it will help us to implement `INotifyPropertyChanged`:

```c#
public partial class TempSample : ObservableObject
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private int _time;

    [ObservableProperty]
    private double _temperature;
}
```

We marked the class as `partial` and inherited from [ObservableObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/observableobject), finally we marked our fields with the [ObservableProperty](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/communitytoolkit/mvvm/generators/observableproperty) attribute, with these changes now the class implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` and also created the `Time` and
`Temperature` properties, the class is ready to notify the UI to update when it changes.

Now to implement `IChartEntity` we need to add 2 properties the `Coordinate` (the location of the point in the UI) and the `MetaData` (just some
information LiveCharts needs to build the chart).

```c#
public partial class TempSample : ObservableObject, IChartEntity
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private int _time;

    [ObservableProperty]
    private double _temperature;

    public Coordinate Coordinate => new(Time, Temperature); // mark

    public ChartEntityMetaData? MetaData { get; set; } // mark
}
```

Now LiveCharts knows that we want the `Time` property in the X axis and the `Temperature` in the Y axis, we are ready to build charts with
this class. But this example is creating a new instance of the `Coordinate` struct every time we access the property, we can cache the coordinate
and only update the value of it when the `Time` or the `Temperature` properties change:

```c#
public partial class TempSample : ObservableObject, IChartEntity
{
    [ObservableProperty]
    private int _time;

    [ObservableProperty]
    private double _temperature;

    public Coordinate Coordinate { get; protected set; }  // mark

    public ChartEntityMetaData? MetaData { get; set; }

    protected override void OnPropertyChanged(PropertyChangedEventArgs e)  // mark
    {  // mark
        Coordinate = new(Time, Temperature);  // mark
        base.OnPropertyChanged(e);  // mark
    }  // mark
}
```

The change we made makes an important improvement in performance than the previous version, specially in large data sets,
This is a general implementation that might work for most of the cases, it has a good performance, but there cases where you can 
simplify a lot in the implementation of `IChartEntity`, there are multiple ways to optimize it for performance, actually you can remove `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface it is not required by LiveCharts.
